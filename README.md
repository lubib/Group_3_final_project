### Presentation Draft
- Selected topic - Precious Metal (aka Olympic Medals)

- Reason the topic was selected - 
Since the opening of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, the international sports competition has only been canceled three times: once during World War I (1916) and twice during World War II (1940, 1944). Until this year. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak the 2020 Olympic Games have been postponed by a year. In anticipation of the Olympic games we decided to try and make a prediction for the games in the future.  

- A question we hope to answer with the data is whether the amount of medals that a country wins can be predicted by the demographics and economic conditions in that country.
